I completed 5 taska of codsoft intern i.e number game , word counter, student management system, ATM interface , address book system in java GUI application.

TASK 1: NUMBER GAME APPLICATION

This application creates a simple number guessing game using a Java GUI application. It generates a random number between 1 and 100, prompts the user to enter their guess, and provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too low, or too high. The game will repeat until the user guesses the number or reaches the maximum number of attempts. The user's score is displayed based on the number of rounds won, and they can choose to play multiple rounds

TASK 2: WORD COUNTER APPLICATION

In this application when you run the WordCounterApp, it will display the instructions to the user as mentioned in the requirements. Users can enter the text in the provided text area, click the "Count Words" button, and additional features such as ignoring common words and providing statistics will work as expected. Input validation is in place to handle empty inputs as well.

TASK 3: STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

In this application we can add, remove, search, edit and display the student details and these all details have saved in the text file.
When we enter the student roll number then we can easily edit the existing student details and it will show the instructions when we move wrong with the application.

TASK 4: ATM INTERFACE

In this application the ATM class interacts with the BankAccount class to perform transactions like withdrawing and depositing. The ATMGUI class provides the graphical user interface for the ATM application, where users can enter amounts and choose transaction options. The current account balance is displayed in a text area, which gets updated after each transaction.

TASK 5: ADDRESS BOOK SYSTEM

In this application, the Contact class represents individual contacts, and the AddressBook class manages the collection of contacts. The AddressBookGUI class provides a graphical user interface for the address book system, where users can add contacts, display all contacts, and view their information. Contact data is stored in a text file and is read and written using the AddressBook class.
